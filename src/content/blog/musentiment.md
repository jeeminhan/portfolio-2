# MuSentiment

For the Texas A&M Datathon (Data Science based Hackathon) me and my team scraped through national data of depression as well as popular songs and tried to find correlation between the release of popular songs (happy or sad) as well as the overall metnal health of the nation. We ended up winning 2nd place in this competitive Datathon as well as Nintendo Switch as our prize!
