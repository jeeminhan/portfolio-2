## Experience

Raytheon is a United States government contractor that makes weapons and fighter jets. I was in a department that worked on the radars. On my 3 month internship there I learned about radar technology as well as my main project was working within the virtulization software Docker and the virtualization software jenkins and creating a script to clean up unused streams within jenkins.
