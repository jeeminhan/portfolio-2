## Combination Lock

Have you ever waited at a very long traffic stop and the light never seems to change? Then you move your car up a little and then the light immediately changes? In America there are many stoplights like this that are operated by a sensor, this is especially helpful in rural areas where there may not be many cars and so you cannot just operate on a time based system. I created this kind of sensor system using an FPGA board and verilog HDL.
