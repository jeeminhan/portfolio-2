# Single Cycle Processor


One of my favorite courses in college was my computer architecture class. For this class we used a raspberry Pi and went into the hardware level (HDL) which was exciting to see what is actually happening for each action a computer makes how there are hundreds of calls underneath the surface. For our final project we created a single cycle processor and tested it out.

I will also include videos to other projects for completion.
